Example Bytes
=============

These are example Bytes to help you get started developing for the Byte app:

**hello-world.js** is the basic Hello World example.

**stock-tracker** is a Byte with user configuration and an external data source. It fetches the current price of the configured stock symbol using the Yahoo Finance API.

**water** is a Byte with user actions. It has a button that you tap to track the number of glases of water you've drunk today.
